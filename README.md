# Anime-DL
Small(for the time being) script to scrape & download series.

## Troubleshooting
Run the following
```
pip install requests
pip install cfscrape
```
If it's still breaking open an issue with the error. Thanks.

## Why do you watch dubbed you inbred faggot?
Because I watch while I work. Meaning I'm not going to be able to write code and read subtitles at the same time. That'd be *retarded*.

## Usage
It's not hard.
```
python animeland.py samurai-champloo 26
```

### Planned features(shit you don't care about)
* ~~Should probably place mp4s in their own folders based on series.~~ **DONE**
* ~~More sites~~ **DONE**
* ~~Not exclusively dubbed downloads~~ **DONE**
* UI for you normiefags.
